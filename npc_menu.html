The Buff NPC appears beside the player to provide re-buffs, granting access to the NPC's menu. Players can cancel the NPC's reappearance by clicking 'unfollow', logging out, or interacting with NPC Sonia near the city's Gatekeeper.
<br1>
The Buff NPC does not appear within instances, however, the player continues to receive re-buffs as usual. Only the player who has subscribed to the Buff NPC Follow support service is authorized to access this NPC's menu. <br1>Should other players attempt to click on the support NPC, an "operation failed" message will appear, and the menu will not be displayed.
